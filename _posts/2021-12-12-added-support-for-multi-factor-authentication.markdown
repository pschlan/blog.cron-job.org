You can now protect your cron-job.org account with Multi-Factor Authentication. We support TOTP apps like Google/Microsoft Authenticator and also Yubikey tokens (via Yubico OTP).

You can start protecting your account by logging into the [Console](https://console.cron-job.org){:target="_blank"}, navigating to "Settings" and adding your first MFA device.
