We’ve just launched a new feature: The cron-job.org REST-style API. You can use the API to view, create, update and delete cron jobs programatically.

Get started by requesting your free API key in the [cron-job.org Console](https://console.cron-job.org){:target="_blank"} at "Settings".

The first version of the API documentation can be found at [https://docs.cron-job.org/rest-api.html](https://docs.cron-job.org/rest-api.html).

In case you’re missing a feature or you have suggestions, please let us know. We’re looking forward to your feedback.
