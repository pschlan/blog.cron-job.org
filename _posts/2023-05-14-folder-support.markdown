You can now organize your cron jobs in folders to keep a better overview.

To get started, open the folder manager by clicking the "Manage Folders" button in the [Console](https://console.cron-job.org){:target="_blank"} at "Cronjobs".

You can move existing jobs to a new folder by editing the job and selecting the new folder from the "Folder" dropdown in the job editor.

Of course, you can also rename and delete folders. In case there are existing jobs in a folder you are deleting, those jobs will be automatically moved to the root folder.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for us, please let us know at [info@cron-job.org](mailto:info@cron-job.org).
